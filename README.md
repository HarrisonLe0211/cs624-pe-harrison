# Hello-World App

## Input
The program uses static input embedded directly within the source code. The predefined texts represent a user’s name, degree program, and school (which is Harrison's in this case). This input is hard-coded into three individual Text components.

## Process
The React Native framework renders the input within a structured layout. The View component acts as a container that spans the entire screen with a yellow background. A StyleSheet applies styling rules across all elements. Each Text component displays the predetermined text.

## Output
The final output is a simple hello page. It presents the user’s name, degree, and school in bold text over a bright yellow background.
